## Project Description

** Silicon Scraper is system that scrapes online retailers for specific information regarding GPUs and CPUs.
<br>The information is then made available to the user via a mobile app where the user can search for a product and <br>
add it to a watch list to be notified of any changes in price or availability etc. One of the more notable features is the ability for the user to request a prediction of price and availability for a product **
